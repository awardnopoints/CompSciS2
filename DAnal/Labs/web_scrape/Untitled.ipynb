      "Dundrum. Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "—Can you recall, brother, is mother Grogan’s tea and water pot\r\n",

      "—I doubt it, said Stephen gravely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Do you now? Buck Mulligan said in the same tone. Your reasons, pray?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I fancy, Stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the\r\n",
      "Mabinogion. Mother Grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of Mary Ann.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened\r\n",

      "a tilly. Old and secret she had entered from a morning world, maybe\r\n",
      "a messenger. She praised the goodness of the milk, pouring it out.\r\n",
      "Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field, a witch on her\r\n",
      "toadstool, her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs. They lowed\r\n",
      "about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. Silk of the kine and poor old\r\n",
      "woman, names given her in old times. A wandering crone, lowly form of\r\n",
      "an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common\r\n",
      "cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. To serve or to upbraid,\r\n",
      "whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—It is indeed, ma’am, Buck Mulligan said, pouring milk into their\r\n",
      "cups.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Taste it, sir, she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He drank at her bidding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—If we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat\r\n",
      "loudly, we wouldn’t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten\r\n",
      "guts. Living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with\r\n",
      "dust, horsedung and consumptives’ spits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I am, ma’am, Buck Mulligan answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Look at that now, she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen listened in scornful silence. She bows her old head to a voice\r\n",
      "that speaks to her loudly, her bonesetter, her medicineman: me she\r\n",
      "slights. To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there\r\n",
      "is of her but her woman’s unclean loins, of man’s flesh made not in\r\n",
      "God’s likeness, the serpent’s prey. And to the loud voice that now\r\n",
      "bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Do you understand what he says? Stephen asked her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Is it French you are talking, sir? the old woman said to Haines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Irish, Buck Mulligan said. Is there Gaelic on you?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I thought it was Irish, she said, by the sound of it. Are you from\r\n",
      "the west, sir?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I am an Englishman, Haines answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—He’s English, Buck Mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak\r\n",
      "Irish in Ireland.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Sure we ought to, the old woman said, and I’m ashamed I don’t\r\n",
      "speak the language myself. I’m told it’s a grand language by them\r\n",
      "that knows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Grand is no name for it, said Buck Mulligan. Wonderful entirely. Fill\r\n",
      "us out some more tea, Kinch. Would you like a cup, ma’am?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—No, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the\r\n",
      "milkcan on her forearm and about to go.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines said to her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Have you your bill? We had better pay her, Mulligan, hadn’t we?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen filled again the three cups.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Bill, sir? she said, halting. Well, it’s seven mornings a pint at\r\n",
      "twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three\r\n",
      "mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. That’s a\r\n",
      "shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Buck Mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly\r\n",
      "buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his\r\n",
      "trouser pockets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Pay up and look pleasant, Haines said to him, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the\r\n",
      "thick rich milk. Buck Mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in\r\n",
      "his fingers and cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—A miracle!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Ask nothing more of me, sweet. All I can give you I give.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—We’ll owe twopence, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. Time enough. Good\r\n",
      "morning, sir.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She curtseyed and went out, followed by Buck Mulligan’s tender chant:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     —Heart of my heart, were it more,\r\n",
      "     More would be laid at your feet.\r\n",
      "He turned to Stephen and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Seriously, Dedalus. I’m stony. Hurry out to your school kip and\r\n",
      "bring us back some money. Today the bards must drink and junket. Ireland\r\n",
      "expects that every man this day will do his duty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—That reminds me, Haines said, rising, that I have to visit your\r\n",
      "national library today.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Our swim first, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned to Stephen and asked blandly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Is this the day for your monthly wash, Kinch?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he said to Haines:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream, Stephen said as he let honey\r\n",
      "trickle over a slice of the loaf.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the\r\n",
      "loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Speaking to me. They wash and tub and scrub. Agenbite of inwit.\r\n",
      "Conscience. Yet here’s a spot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol\r\n",
      "of Irish art is deuced good.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen’s foot under the table and said with\r\n",
      "warmth of tone:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Wait till you hear him on Hamlet, Haines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Well, I mean it, Haines said, still speaking to Stephen. I was just\r\n",
      "thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Would I make any money by it? Stephen asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of\r\n",
      "the hammock, said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I don’t know, I’m sure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He strolled out to the doorway. Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and\r\n",
      "said with coarse vigour:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—You put your hoof in it now. What did you say that for?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Well? Stephen said. The problem is to get money. From whom? From the\r\n",
      "milkwoman or from him. It’s a toss up, I think.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I blow him out about you, Buck Mulligan said, and then you come along\r\n",
      "with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I see little hope, Stephen said, from her or from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen’s arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—From me, Kinch, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a suddenly changed tone he added:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—To tell you the God’s truth I think you’re right. Damn all else\r\n",
      "they are good for. Why don’t you play them as I do? To hell with them\r\n",
      "all. Let us get out of the kip.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying\r\n",
      "resignedly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Mulligan is stripped of his garments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He emptied his pockets on to the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—There’s your snotrag, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them,\r\n",
      "chiding them, and to his dangling watchchain. His hands plunged and\r\n",
      "rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief. God,\r\n",
      "we’ll simply have to dress the character. I want puce gloves and\r\n",
      "green boots. Contradiction. Do I contradict myself? Very well then, I\r\n",
      "contradict myself. Mercurial Malachi. A limp black missile flew out of\r\n",
      "his talking hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—And there’s your Latin quarter hat, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen picked it up and put it on. Haines called to them from the\r\n",
      "doorway:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Are you coming, you fellows?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I’m ready, Buck Mulligan answered, going towards the door. Come\r\n",
      "out, Kinch. You have eaten all we left, I suppose. Resigned he passed\r\n",
      "out with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—And going forth he met Butterly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out\r\n",
      "and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and\r\n",
      "locked it. He put the huge key in his inner pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Did you bring the key?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I have it, Stephen said, preceding them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked on. Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy\r\n",
      "bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Down, sir! How dare you, sir!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Do you pay rent for this tower?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Twelve quid, Buck Mulligan said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—To the secretary of state for war, Stephen added over his shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Rather bleak in wintertime, I should say. Martello you call it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Billy Pitt had them built, Buck Mulligan said, when the French were\r\n",
      "on the sea. But ours is the omphalos.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—What is your idea of Hamlet? Haines asked Stephen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—No, no, Buck Mulligan shouted in pain. I’m not equal to Thomas\r\n",
      "Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up. Wait\r\n",
      "till I have a few pints in me first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned to Stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his\r\n",
      "primrose waistcoat:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—You couldn’t manage it under three pints, Kinch, could you?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—It has waited so long, Stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—You pique my curiosity, Haines said amiably. Is it some paradox?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes.\r\n",
      "It’s quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet’s grandson is\r\n",
      "Shakespeare’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own\r\n",
      "father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in\r\n",
      "loose laughter, said to Stephen’s ear:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—We’re always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it\r\n",
      "is rather long to tell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this\r\n",
      "tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. That beetles\r\n",
      "o’er his base into the sea, isn’t it?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not\r\n",
      "speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap\r\n",
      "dusty mourning between their gay attires.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—It’s a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent.\r\n",
      "The seas’ ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for\r\n",
      "the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail\r\n",
      "tacking by the Muglins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused.\r\n",
      "The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the\r\n",
      "Father.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked\r\n",
      "at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had\r\n",
      "suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved\r\n",
      "a doll’s head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and\r\n",
      "began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     —I’m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.\r\n",
      "     My mother’s a jew, my father’s a bird.\r\n",
      "     With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree.\r\n",
      "     So here’s to disciples and Calvary.\r\n",
      "He held up a forefinger of warning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     —If anyone thinks that I amn’t divine\r\n",
      "     He’ll get no free drinks when I’m making the wine\r\n",
      "     But have to drink water and wish it were plain\r\n",
      "     That I make when the wine becomes water again.\r\n",
      "He tugged swiftly at Stephen’s ashplant in farewell and, running\r\n",
      "forward to a brow of the cliff, fluttered his hands at his sides like\r\n",
      "fins or wings of one about to rise in the air, and chanted:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     —Goodbye, now, goodbye! Write down all I said\r\n",
      "     And tell Tom, Dick and Harry I rose from the dead.\r\n",
      "     What’s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly\r\n",
      "     And Olivet’s breezy... Goodbye, now, goodbye!\r\n",
      "He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole, fluttering his\r\n",
      "winglike hands, leaping nimbly, Mercury’s hat quivering in the fresh\r\n",
      "wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines, who had been laughing guardedly, walked on beside Stephen and\r\n",
      "said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—We oughtn’t to laugh, I suppose. He’s rather blasphemous. I’m\r\n",
      "not a believer myself, that is to say. Still his gaiety takes the harm\r\n",
      "out of it somehow, doesn’t it? What did he call it? Joseph the Joiner?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—The ballad of joking Jesus, Stephen answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—O, Haines said, you have heard it before?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Three times a day, after meals, Stephen said drily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—You’re not a believer, are you? Haines asked. I mean, a believer in\r\n",
      "the narrow sense of the word. Creation from nothing and miracles and a\r\n",
      "personal God.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—There’s only one sense of the word, it seems to me, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a\r\n",
      "green stone. He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Thank you, Stephen said, taking a cigarette.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines helped himself and snapped the case to. He put it back in his\r\n",
      "sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox, sprang\r\n",
      "it open too, and, having lit his cigarette, held the flaming spunk\r\n",
      "towards Stephen in the shell of his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Yes, of course, he said, as they went on again. Either you believe or\r\n",
      "you don’t, isn’t it? Personally I couldn’t stomach that idea of a\r\n",
      "personal God. You don’t stand for that, I suppose?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—You behold in me, Stephen said with grim displeasure, a horrible\r\n",
      "example of free thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked on, waiting to be spoken to, trailing his ashplant by his\r\n",
      "side. Its ferrule followed lightly on the path, squealing at his heels.\r\n",
      "My familiar, after me, calling, Steeeeeeeeeeeephen! A wavering line\r\n",
      "along the path. They will walk on it tonight, coming here in the dark.\r\n",
      "He wants that key. It is mine. I paid the rent. Now I eat his salt\r\n",
      "bread. Give him the key too. All. He will ask for it. That was in his\r\n",
      "eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—After all, Haines began...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not\r\n",
      "all unkind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—After all, I should think you are able to free yourself. You are your\r\n",
      "own master, it seems to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I am a servant of two masters, Stephen said, an English and an\r\n",
      "Italian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Italian? Haines said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A crazy queen, old and jealous. Kneel down before me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and\r\n",
      "the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he\r\n",
      "spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think\r\n",
      "like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather\r\n",
      "unfairly. It seems history is to blame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like him was I, these sloping shoulders, this gracelessness. My\r\n",
      "childhood bends beside me. Too far for me to lay a hand there once or\r\n",
      "lightly. Mine is far and his secret as our eyes. Secrets, silent, stony\r\n",
      "sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts: secrets weary of their\r\n",
      "tyranny: tyrants, willing to be dethroned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sum was done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—It is very simple, Stephen said as he stood up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Yes, sir. Thanks, Sargent answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his\r\n",
      "copybook back to his bench.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—You had better get your stick and go out to the others, Stephen said\r\n",
      "as he followed towards the door the boy’s graceless form.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Yes, sir.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the corridor his name was heard, called from the playfield.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Sargent!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Run on, Stephen said. Mr Deasy is calling you.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy\r\n",
      "field where sharp voices were in strife. They were sorted in teams and\r\n",
      "Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet. When\r\n",
      "he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him. He\r\n",
      "turned his angry white moustache.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—What is it now? he cried continually without listening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side, sir, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Will you wait in my study for a moment, Mr Deasy said, till I restore\r\n",
      "order here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man’s voice\r\n",
      "cried sternly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—What is the matter? What is it now?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides: their many forms closed\r\n",
      "round him, the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather\r\n",
      "of its chairs. As on the first day he bargained with me here. As it was\r\n",
      "in the beginning, is now. On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins,\r\n",
      "base treasure of a bog: and ever shall be. And snug in their spooncase\r\n",
      "of purple plush, faded, the twelve apostles having preached to all the\r\n",
      "gentiles: world without end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor. Blowing out his\r\n",
      "rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—First, our little financial settlement, he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong. It\r\n",
      "slapped open and he took from it two notes, one of joined halves, and\r\n",
      "laid them carefully on the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Two, he said, strapping and stowing his pocketbook away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now his strongroom for the gold. Stephen’s embarrassed hand\r\n",
      "moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar: whelks and money\r\n",
      "cowries and leopard shells: and this, whorled as an emir’s turban,\r\n",
      "and this, the scallop of saint James. An old pilgrim’s hoard, dead\r\n",
      "treasure, hollow shells.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A sovereign fell, bright and new, on the soft pile of the tablecloth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Three, Mr Deasy said, turning his little savingsbox about in his\r\n",
      "hand. These are handy things to have. See. This is for sovereigns. This\r\n",
      "is for shillings. Sixpences, halfcrowns. And here crowns. See.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He shot from it two crowns and two shillings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Three twelve, he said. I think you’ll find that’s right.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Thank you, sir, Stephen said, gathering the money together with shy\r\n",
      "haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—No thanks at all, Mr Deasy said. You have earned it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen’s hand, free again, went back to the hollow shells. Symbols\r\n",
      "too of beauty and of power. A lump in my pocket: symbols soiled by greed\r\n",
      "and misery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Don’t carry it like that, Mr Deasy said. You’ll pull it out\r\n",
      "somewhere and lose it. You just buy one of these machines. You’ll find\r\n",
      "them very handy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Answer something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Mine would be often empty, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The same room and hour, the same wisdom: and I the same. Three times\r\n",
      "now. Three nooses round me here. Well? I can break them in this instant\r\n",
      "if I will.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Because you don’t save, Mr Deasy said, pointing his finger. You\r\n",
      "don’t know yet what money is. Money is power. When you have lived\r\n",
      "as long as I have. I know, I know. If youth but knew. But what does\r\n",
      "Shakespeare say? Put but money in thy purse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Iago, Stephen murmured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man’s stare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—He knew what money was, Mr Deasy said. He made money. A poet, yes,\r\n",
      "but an Englishman too. Do you know what is the pride of the English?\r\n",
      "Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an\r\n",
      "Englishman’s mouth?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The seas’ ruler. His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay: it seems\r\n",
      "history is to blame: on me and on my words, unhating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—That on his empire, Stephen said, the sun never sets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Ba! Mr Deasy cried. That’s not English. A French Celt said that. He\r\n",
      "tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I will tell you, he said solemnly, what is his proudest boast. I paid\r\n",
      "my way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Good man, good man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I paid my way. I never borrowed a shilling in my life. Can you feel\r\n",
      "that? I owe nothing. Can you?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mulligan, nine pounds, three pairs of socks, one pair brogues, ties.\r\n",
      "Curran, ten guineas. McCann, one guinea. Fred Ryan, two shillings.\r\n",
      "Temple, two lunches. Russell, one guinea, Cousins, ten shillings, Bob\r\n",
      "Reynolds, half a guinea, Koehler, three guineas, Mrs MacKernan, five\r\n",
      "weeks’ board. The lump I have is useless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—For the moment, no, Stephen answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight, putting back his savingsbox.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I knew you couldn’t, he said joyously. But one day you must feel\r\n",
      "it. We are a generous people but we must also be just.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I fear those big words, Stephen said, which make us so unhappy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the\r\n",
      "shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs: Albert Edward, prince of\r\n",
      "Wales.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—You think me an old fogey and an old tory, his thoughtful voice\r\n",
      "said. I saw three generations since O’Connell’s time. I remember the\r\n",
      "famine in ’46. Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal\r\n",
      "of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates\r\n",
      "of your communion denounced him as a demagogue? You fenians forget some\r\n",
      "things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Glorious, pious and immortal memory. The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the\r\n",
      "splendid behung with corpses of papishes. Hoarse, masked and armed, the\r\n",
      "planters’ covenant. The black north and true blue bible. Croppies lie\r\n",
      "down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen sketched a brief gesture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I have rebel blood in me too, Mr Deasy said. On the spindle side. But\r\n",
      "I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union. We are\r\n",
      "all Irish, all kings’ sons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Alas, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Per vias rectas, Mr Deasy said firmly, was his motto. He voted for\r\n",
      "it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do\r\n",
      "so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     Lal the ral the ra\r\n",
      "     The rocky road to Dublin.\r\n",
      "A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots. Soft day, sir John!\r\n",
      "Soft day, your honour!... Day!... Day!... Two topboots jog dangling on\r\n",
      "to Dublin. Lal the ral the ra. Lal the ral the raddy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—That reminds me, Mr Deasy said. You can do me a favour, Mr Dedalus,\r\n",
      "with some of your literary friends. I have a letter here for the press.\r\n",
      "Sit down a moment. I have just to copy the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went to the desk near the window, pulled in his chair twice and read\r\n",
      "off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Sit down. Excuse me, he said over his shoulder, the dictates of\r\n",
      "common sense. Just a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow\r\n",
      "and, muttering, began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly,\r\n",
      "sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence. Framed\r\n",
      "around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage, their\r\n",
      "meek heads poised in air: lord Hastings’ Repulse, the duke of\r\n",
      "Westminster’s Shotover, the duke of Beaufort’s Ceylon, prix de\r\n",
      "Paris, 1866. Elfin riders sat them, watchful of a sign. He saw their\r\n",
      "speeds, backing king’s colours, and shouted with the shouts of\r\n",
      "vanished crowds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Full stop, Mr Deasy bade his keys. But prompt ventilation of this\r\n",
      "allimportant question...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Where Cranly led me to get rich quick, hunting his winners among the\r\n",
      "mudsplashed brakes, amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek\r\n",
      "of the canteen, over the motley slush. Even money Fair Rebel. Ten to one\r\n",
      "the field. Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs, the\r\n",
      "vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman, a butcher’s dame,\r\n",
      "nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shouts rang shrill from the boys’ playfield and a whirring whistle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again: a goal. I am among them, among their battling bodies in a medley,\r\n",
      "the joust of life. You mean that knockkneed mother’s darling who seems\r\n",
      "to be slightly crawsick? Jousts. Time shocked rebounds, shock by shock.\r\n",
      "Jousts, slush and uproar of battles, the frozen deathspew of the slain,\r\n",
      "a shout of spearspikes baited with men’s bloodied guts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Now then, Mr Deasy said, rising.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He came to the table, pinning together his sheets. Stephen stood up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I have put the matter into a nutshell, Mr Deasy said. It’s about\r\n",
      "the foot and mouth disease. Just look through it. There can be no two\r\n",
      "opinions on the matter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "May I trespass on your valuable space. That doctrine of laissez faire\r\n",
      "which so often in our history. Our cattle trade. The way of all our old\r\n",
      "industries. Liverpool ring which jockeyed the Galway harbour scheme.\r\n",
      "European conflagration. Grain supplies through the narrow waters of\r\n",
      "the channel. The pluterperfect imperturbability of the department of\r\n",
      "agriculture. Pardoned a classical allusion. Cassandra. By a woman who\r\n",
      "was no better than she should be. To come to the point at issue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I don’t mince words, do I? Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Foot and mouth disease. Known as Koch’s preparation. Serum and\r\n",
      "virus. Percentage of salted horses. Rinderpest. Emperor’s horses at\r\n",
      "Mürzsteg, lower Austria. Veterinary surgeons. Mr Henry Blackwood Price.\r\n",
      "Courteous offer a fair trial. Dictates of common sense. Allimportant\r\n",
      "question. In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns.\r\n",
      "Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I want that to be printed and read, Mr Deasy said. You will see at\r\n",
      "the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle. And it can\r\n",
      "be cured. It is cured. My cousin, Blackwood Price, writes to me it is\r\n",
      "regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there. They\r\n",
      "offer to come over here. I am trying to work up influence with the\r\n",
      "department. Now I’m going to try publicity. I am surrounded by\r\n",
      "difficulties, by... intrigues by... backstairs influence by...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Mark my words, Mr Dedalus, he said. England is in the hands of the\r\n",
      "jews. In all the highest places: her finance, her press. And they are\r\n",
      "the signs of a nation’s decay. Wherever they gather they eat up the\r\n",
      "nation’s vital strength. I have seen it coming these years. As sure\r\n",
      "as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of\r\n",
      "destruction. Old England is dying.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stepped swiftly off, his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a\r\n",
      "broad sunbeam. He faced about and back again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Dying, he said again, if not dead by now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     The harlot’s cry from street to street\r\n",
      "     Shall weave old England’s windingsheet.\r\n",
      "His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which\r\n",
      "he halted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—A merchant, Stephen said, is one who buys cheap and sells dear, jew\r\n",
      "or gentile, is he not?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—They sinned against the light, Mr Deasy said gravely. And you can see\r\n",
      "the darkness in their eyes. And that is why they are wanderers on the\r\n",
      "earth to this day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting\r\n",
      "prices on their gemmed fingers. Gabble of geese. They swarmed loud,\r\n",
      "uncouth about the temple, their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk\r\n",
      "hats. Not theirs: these clothes, this speech, these gestures. Their full\r\n",
      "slow eyes belied the words, the gestures eager and unoffending, but\r\n",
      "knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain. Vain\r\n",
      "patience to heap and hoard. Time surely would scatter all. A hoard\r\n",
      "heaped by the roadside: plundered and passing on. Their eyes knew their\r\n",
      "years of wandering and, patient, knew the dishonours of their flesh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Who has not? Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—What do you mean? Mr Deasy asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He came forward a pace and stood by the table. His underjaw fell\r\n",
      "sideways open uncertainly. Is this old wisdom? He waits to hear from me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—History, Stephen said, is a nightmare from which I am trying to\r\n",
      "awake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From the playfield the boys raised a shout. A whirring whistle: goal.\r\n",
      "What if that nightmare gave you a back kick?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—The ways of the Creator are not our ways, Mr Deasy said. All human\r\n",
      "history moves towards one great goal, the manifestation of God.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—That is God.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hooray! Ay! Whrrwhee!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—What? Mr Deasy asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—A shout in the street, Stephen answered, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked\r\n",
      "between his fingers. Looking up again he set them free.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I am happier than you are, he said. We have committed many errors and\r\n",
      "many sins. A woman brought sin into the world. For a woman who was no\r\n",
      "better than she should be, Helen, the runaway wife of Menelaus, ten\r\n",
      "years the Greeks made war on Troy. A faithless wife first brought\r\n",
      "the strangers to our shore here, MacMurrough’s wife and her leman,\r\n",
      "O’Rourke, prince of Breffni. A woman too brought Parnell low. Many\r\n",
      "errors, many failures but not the one sin. I am a struggler now at the\r\n",
      "end of my days. But I will fight for the right till the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "     For Ulster will fight\r\n",
      "     And Ulster will be right.\r\n",
      "Stephen raised the sheets in his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Well, sir, he began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I foresee, Mr Deasy said, that you will not remain here very long\r\n",
      "at this work. You were not born to be a teacher, I think. Perhaps I am\r\n",
      "wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—A learner rather, Stephen said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And here what will you learn more?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr Deasy shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Who knows? he said. To learn one must be humble. But life is the\r\n",
      "great teacher.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stephen rustled the sheets again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—As regards these, he began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—Yes, Mr Deasy said. You have two copies there. If you can have them\r\n",
      "published at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Telegraph. Irish Homestead.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two\r\n",
      "editors slightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field,\r\n",
      "M.P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders’ association today at the\r\n",
      "City Arms hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You\r\n",
      "see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—The Evening Telegraph...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "—That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to\r\n",
      "answer that letter from my cousin.\r\n",
